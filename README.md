# snitchfrank
###Tool's brief history
Snitch Frank is a tool that takes advantage of the online service called Franklin Fueling System TS-550. This exploit was firstly found by Parsa Rezaie Khiabanloo and posted on Exploit DB on 2023.04.07. This exploit was later adapted by me, Klarine, to become automated and much less time consuming so you can spend your time on finding vulnerable servers instead of just entering all commands manually.
